<blockquote>
  <p>A challenger to one of the most addictive apps out there, Tally Board surpasses the usual sliding block game formula with a greater focus on mental arithmetic and planning ahead.</p>

  <p>Tally Board was developed as a project to learn development for mobile devices. The app got very good reviews both online and in the App-Store, avareging about 4.3 out of 5.</p>

<p>Because I needed to focus on school, and not marketing and maintenance, I eventually withdrew the app. I would love to revisit this project in due time, as I firmly believe that the idea was unique, and the app was both eucational and entertaining.</p>
