I am a up-and-coming developer from Norway. Professionally, I am an electrician. By desire, I am a computer- and sciencegeek.


<div class="center">{% include image.html alt="Runar Kristoffersen Profile Picture" image="Runar.jpg" sizes="50vw" class="float-left img-circle"%}</div>

Currently I am working my way through the [Full Stack Web Developer](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004)-course, which is a Nanodegree hosted by Udacity, co-created by Amazon, GitHub, At&T and Google.

I hope to make this my starting path to learning a series of web-technologies, by building on what I already have learned from various computer-projects like creating apps, games and productivity-tools.
