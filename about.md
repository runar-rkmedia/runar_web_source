I am a up-and-coming developer from Norway. Professionally, I am an electrician. By desire, I am a computer- and sciencegeek.

I love to create tools to make workflows more appreciative, faster and less troublesome. I often invest time to learn how to automate a mundane task, and over time build better and better practices.

I do not believe in multitasking, so removing unneeded subtasks is a great way to increase productivity.
