For quite some time I've been using just regular flat keyboards, mostly because as a student I used my laptop a lot. When working on my desktop I wanted a similar keyboard, so I went with a flat Logitech-keyboard.

However, I did not realise how the non-existing ergonomics of keyboards like these were until I started coding again. This fact was not helped by the fact that the Norwegian-keyboard-layout is not very programmer-friendly. To make a simple curly-brace, I would do `Shift+9`, which meant either stretching or moving my hands. This holds true for a number of keys.

I tried switching to the US-layout, but as I was writing quite a bit in Norwegian too, this was not an optimal solution. Of course, I could change layouts on the fly, but as so many of the keys change between layouts, this neither was a reliable option.

For a while, I tried to remap some keys to make this easier. `Caps-lock` is a pretty useless key, so I used that in combination with other keys for brackets and such. I remapped all my modifier keys to behave differently while just tapping them so that I could tap `Ctrl` for parentheses, and also do stuff like `Shift-Ctrl` (hold shift, tap Ctrl) to close parentheses.

I was happy for a while, but after spending hours coding, I noticed some beginning fatigue in my hands. No pain yet, but I knew I needed to do something before I got any lasting damage.

## Advantage

After poking around the internet, I found a weird looking keyboard made by a company called Kinesis. The Advantage 2. A huge, split keyboard with contoured wells for my hands, with modifier keys for both my thumbs. In all these years I found it strange that the strongest finger (albeit not technically a finger) would be assigned only to hitting the spacebar. This was a strange new world. This was too much of an adjustment.




Time went by, and I looked for other keyboards, event tried a few more regular but ergonomic keyboards. However, my attention went back to the Advantage 2. I couldn't get this odd keyboard out of my head. I heard good things about it. So I ordered one.

### First impressions: Terribly, utterly terrible

My typing speed was horrible. I couldn't understand how I was ever going to relearn how to type. I kept hitting the wrong key or two keys at once. Why was I hitting two keys? Well, a regular keyboard does not arrange their keys in straight rows, but semi-diagonally. But here, since the keys are curved, I guess they figured it was better to keep the keys in straight rows.

Writing emails was a pain. I was just about done with this keyboard.

### No more fatigue

It has been a few days. The fatigue was gone. And I was starting to get used to the strange beast of a keyboard. Even though my writing speed was still much slower than before, it took a lot less effort. Now it feels smooth. I hardly ever move my hands, nor do I stretch my fingers. My keys are right where I need them to be.

### Special features

The keyboard has some more advanced features. It can be programmed on the keyboard itself so that if you switch computers, your layout, settings and macros are with you. You can even store snippets on there, for often typed phrases. You can change your layout from Qwerty to Dworak with the push of a button, enable or disable a _click_-tone for you key-presses, to let you know when a key-press is detected to hinder bottoming the keys.

All of these settings and more can be set either on the keyboard as explained, but also from your computer. The keyboard actually shows up as a removable disk, with a few folders and files. Here you can do firmware updates without any installation files at all. Nothing is installed on your computer. Changing of settings is done through editing regular text files. You could create multiple profiles for your layouts if you were to need that.

### Verdict

I like this keyboard. It has only been a few weeks, and I am typing a lot more consistent than I used to, if not faster.

I do not like using other keyboards if I have to, but I find that I am typing faster on them than before. I think that is because the Advantage forces you to keep your hands where they should be, and your index fingers naturally fall on F and J, where they should be.

I don't use my mouse as much, and I am a lot quicker than I was before. Because the modifier keys are so much more accessible and closer to my hands, doing key-combos are easier. Before I was mostly just doing combos with my left-hand. This I believe was because the flat little keyboard was not wide enough so my hands would not naturally rest at writing position. My hands were almost cramped together. See the image below for a clear difference.

Some modifications are needed. I'll dive into them in my next post, as well as how to remap keys, not just for this keyboard, but for any keyboard.
